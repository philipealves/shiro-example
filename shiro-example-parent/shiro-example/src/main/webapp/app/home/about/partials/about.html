<h2>Introduction to Apache Shiro</h2>

<h3>What is Apache Shiro?</h3>

<p>Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source security
	framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization,
	enterprise session management and cryptography.</p>

<p>Apache Shiro's first and foremost goal is to be easy to use and
	understand. Security can be very complex at times, even painful, but it
	doesn't have to be. A framework should mask complexities where possible
	and expose a clean and intuitive API that simplifies the developer's
	effort to make their application(s) secure.</p>

<p>Here are some things that you can do with Apache Shiro:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Authenticate a user to verify their identity</li>
	<li>Perform access control for a user, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Determine if a user is assigned a certain security role or
				not</li>
			<li>Determine if a user is permitted to do something or not</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Use a Session API in any environment, even without web or EJB
		containers.</li>
	<li>React to events during authentication, access control, or
		during a session's lifetime.</li>
	<li>Aggregate 1 or more data sources of user security data and
		present this all as a single composite user 'view'.</li>
	<li>Enable Single Sign On (SSO) functionality</li>
	<li>Enable 'Remember Me' services for user association without
		login</li>
</ul>

<p>Shiro attempts to achieve these goals for all application
	environments - from the simplest command line application to the
	largest enterprise applications, without forcing dependencies on other
	3rd party frameworks, containers, or application servers. Of course the
	project aims to integrate into these environments wherever possible,
	but it could be used out-of-the-box in any environment.</p>

<h3>Apache Shiro Features</h3>

<p>Apache Shiro is a comprehensive application security framework
	with many features. The following diagram shows where Shiro focuses its
	energy, and this reference manual will be organized similarly:</p>

<p>Shiro targets what the Shiro development team calls "the four
	cornerstones of application security" - Authentication, Authorization,
	Session Management, and Cryptography:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Sometimes referred to as
		'login', this is the act of proving a user is who they say they are.</li>
	<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> The process of access control,
		i.e. determining 'who' has access to 'what'.</li>
	<li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Managing user-specific
		sessions, even in non-web or EJB applications.</li>
	<li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Keeping data secure using
		cryptographic algorithms while still being easy to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also additional features to support and reinforce these
	concerns in different application environments, especially:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Web Support: Shiro's web support APIs help easily secure web
		applications.</li>
	<li>Caching: Caching is a first-tier citizen in Apache Shiro's API
		to ensure that security operations remain fast and efficient.</li>
	<li>Concurrency: Apache Shiro supports multi-threaded applications
		with its concurrency features.</li>
	<li>Testing: Test support exists to help you write unit and
		integration tests and ensure your code will be secured as expected.</li>
	<li>"Run As": A feature that allows users to assume the identity
		of another user (if they are allowed), sometimes useful in
		administrative scenarios.</li>
	<li>"Remember Me": Remember users' identities across sessions so
		they only need to log in when mandatory.</li>
</ul>
